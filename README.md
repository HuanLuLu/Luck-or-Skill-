# Luck-or-Skill-
Several days ago, when I was feeling frustrated about finding a job, my English tutor Robert Juza from Cambly recommended a video called "Is Success Luck or Hard Work?" made by Veritasium on Youtube[1]. In that video, the author mentioned a fascinating experiment to demonstrate that luck will play a more critical role in our daily lives and professional careers than we think.

The experiment is based on a class of NASA astronauts in 2017. There were 18300 applicants, and only 11 were selected and went to graduate from the astronaut training program. The author built a model and assumed the applicants were selected based on skill, experience, and hard work (total 95%) and also 5% as the result of luck. Veritasium randomly generated a skill score and a luck score out of 100 separately for each applicant, then got the weighted sum as the final score. After running the model a thousand times and comparing the ranks based on only skill and skill plus luck, the conclusion is very interesting." Even with luck accounting for just 5% of the outcome, 9 or maybe 10 of the 11 applicants selected would have been different if luck played no role at all," said Veritasium. 

The luck is overwhelmed overweighted, in my opinion. I decided to rebuild the model and test it.
